Test for checking zmq_getsockopt with option ZMQ_RCVMORE

Test send 10 message, each contains 3 parts. 
Receiver should receive these messages, bot zmq_getsockopt(ZMQ_RCVMORE) is returning 0 after second part.
In effect we do not get the last part.

Test writes to console some info, right now it looks like this:
test_send_more running...
Received: sender
Received: receiv
End of message, got 2 parts
router_test_more: router_test_more.c:110: int main(): Assertion `parts == 3' failed

Should look like: 
test_send_more running...
Received: sender
Received: receiv
Received: message 0
End of message, got 3 parts
Received: sender
Received: receiv
Received: message 1
End of message, got 3 parts

and go on....
